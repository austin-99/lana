                baby, I miss you too. I hate every second when I'm not with you. 
                I always think about how much you mean to me and how much I love you 
                whenever I'm missing you. But missing me will only be temporary baby 
                because you always have me. I love you so much cutie

                you aren't tired. you should close your eyes and list to those calming 
                songs that I've sent you. Also, if I'm asleep right now, just know that 
                I'm happily dreaming of you. Listen to one of my favourites: <br>

                don't worry baby, when I'm there with you I will always protect you
                from all the roaches. I'll always protect you from the things you're
                scared of and one day I'll learn to get over my fear of spiders so
                we dont need to burn our house down when we see a spider 1 inch+ long.

                You never really give me a true reason to be mad at you. Even during an argument,
                I am still so in love with you. I love you unconditionally.

                Even if it feels so real, just everything in your dream never happened in reality.
                I'll comfort you whenever I wake up baby. I love you so much and try to listen to music

                because you are new and you need to learn. if the nurses are mean to you, it
                just means that they hate their lives so it has nothing to do with you. you
                are just there to learn and to have fun experiencing what it's like to be the
