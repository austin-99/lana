        <p>Hey sweetheart, I finally completed our treehouse. This treehouse is so special to me because it reminds me of you and how precious you are to me. I went all over the world and in the nethers to find and craft special things for a sweet girl like you. <br><br>
        I have the date of when I completed the treehouse so it can be a reminder of the day it was officially done and that it will last forever. I found a new flower for you. It's a red tulip and I know how much you love those. If I see more of them I will keep replacing fresh tulips for you and I'll collect the older ones and put them in a chest together. I also made lots of cookies for you they are chocolate chips (sorry they didn't have double chocolate chip). Then I went to my honeybees and they gave me lots of honeycombs for you because they know how sweet you are. Next, I put a bookshelf so we can read books in our treehouse and relax. I put a soul lantern there too because you are my soulmate Lana. <br><br> I have a ladder so we can go up to the second floor where I made purple beds for us (your favourite colour) and then I have a jukebox so we can listen to all the minecraft songs together. I have an enchantment table so we can enchant things and became the strongest team ever on minecraft. I cooked some potions for you so that you'll always be protected and that you can have night vision. I went around to look for the special ingredients and I cooked it with love to make the potions. I went and made an ender chest for you. It is a magic box, meaning that only you can see what is in it so no one can ever steal it from you. 
        <br><br>
        You mean so much to me Lana, I'll forever save this treehouse of ours because it is so deep and it means so much to me. It also has a swing for us to hold each other and to talk while looking at the stars. I'm so lucky that I got to make this for you. I love you Lana
