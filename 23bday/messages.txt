I love how you’ll always allow me to play with your feet
I love how I always get to wake up knowing how lucky I am to have the most amazing girl in the world 
I love how our love will last for an eternity and I love how it's with you
I love how you have my whole heart and everything about you is so meaningful to me
I love how it makes you laugh so hard when I’d tell you I hold onto my backpack and run to class
I love how you’d never do drugs 
I love how whenever I tell you I love you and I miss you, you always say it back
I love how we get to talk about all the posts I tell you about from reddit and you make me feel so comfortable doing that
I love how even spending a second with you can make me the happiest guy in the world
I love how perfect you are for me and there’s nothing I want to change about you
